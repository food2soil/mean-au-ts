            <h1>Welcome to the Food2Soil Compost Tracker!</h1>
            <p>
              Food2Soil is a cooperative of a growing group of businesses and gardeners in San Diego who want to direct their waste so it creates jobs and resources for the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hire local composters to pick up pre-consumer food waste from participating restaurants and compost them at neighborhood community gardens and urban farms. The soil produced helps local gardeners to grow food.
            </p>
